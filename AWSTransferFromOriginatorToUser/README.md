Title: AWS Lambda for Tokenized Asset Transfers

Description:
This AWS Lambda function facilitates the transfer of tokenized assets from originators to users by interacting with Ethereum smart contracts. It uses ethers.js for blockchain interaction and AWS DynamoDB to manage private keys securely. In this lambda we are not using PERMIT. Because all Originator wallets are funded and setup manually. 

Features

    Secure token transfer between blockchain addresses.
    Integration with Ethereum smart contracts using ethers.js.
    Private key management using AWS DynamoDB for enhanced security.
    Detailed logging for easy debugging and transaction verification.

Prerequisites

    AWS Account with access to Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.
    Node.js and npm installed for local development.
    Basic understanding of Ethereum and smart contract operations.

Setup and Deployment

    Lambda Function Setup:
        Clone the repository to your local environment.
        Run npm install aws-sdk ethers to install dependencies.
        Configure your DynamoDB table WalletData to store wallet addresses and private keys.
        Zip your project files including node_modules.
        Upload the zip file to AWS Lambda and configure the function to trigger via API Gateway.

    API Gateway Configuration:
        Create a new API Gateway endpoint that triggers the Lambda function.
        Set up a POST method for the API that can handle JSON requests.

    DynamoDB Configuration:
        Ensure your WalletData table is set up with id as the primary key.
        Securely store private keys and ensure they are encrypted at rest.

Usage

    Endpoint: POST /transfer-token
    Request Body:

    json

{
  "contractAddress": "0x123...",
  "fromAddress": "0xabc...",
  "toAddress": "0xdef...",
  "amount": "10"
}

Successful Response:

json

{
  "message": "Transaction complete"
}

Error Response:

json

    {
      "message": "Invalid request"
    }

Security Considerations

    Ensure that private keys are never hard-coded into your Lambda function. Use AWS Secrets Manager to manage sensitive data.
    Validate all input to the Lambda function to prevent injection attacks or malformed data from causing errors.

Error Handling

    The function includes error handling that distinguishes between client errors (400 series) and server errors (500 series).
    All errors are logged with detailed messages to assist with troubleshooting.
