Title: AWS Lambda Smart Contract Interaction Tool

Description:
This repository contains an AWS Lambda function designed to interact with Ethereum-based smart contracts. The function generate Permit using the privateKey and handles assigning permits in smart contracts by accepting wallet addresses and amounts, then using Ethereum's ethers.js library to execute smart contract functions securely and efficiently.
Features

    Validates input data (wallet addresses and amounts).
    Fetches private keys securely from AWS DynamoDB.
    Signs and sends transactions using ethers.js.
    Handles Ethereum smart contract interactions with robust error management.

Prerequisites

    AWS Account with access to Lambda and DynamoDB.
    Node.js and npm installed for local development.
    An Ethereum wallet and a smart contract to interact with.

Setup and Deployment

    Lambda Function Deployment:
        Clone the repository to your local machine.
        Install necessary npm packages: npm install aws-sdk ethers.
        Zip the code and dependencies.
        Create a new Lambda function in AWS Management Console and upload the zip file.
        Set the execution role with appropriate permissions for Lambda and DynamoDB.

    DynamoDB Configuration:
        Create a table named WalletData with a primary key id which stores wallet addresses and their corresponding private keys.

    API Gateway Integration:
        Setup an API Gateway to trigger the Lambda function.
        Configure a POST method for incoming requests.

Usage

    Endpoint: POST /assign-permit
    Request Body:

    json

{
  "ownerAddress": "0x123...",
  "amount": "100"
}

Successful Response:

json

{
  "message": "Transaction complete"
}

Error Response:

json

    {
      "message": "Invalid request"
    }

Security Considerations

    Ensure private keys stored in DynamoDB are encrypted and access is tightly controlled.
    Review the use of ethers.js for potential vulnerabilities in contract interaction.

Error Handling

    Detailed logging for debugging.
    Catches and handles different types of exceptions.
