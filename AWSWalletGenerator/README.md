Title: AWS Lambda Ethereum Wallet Generator

Description:
This AWS Lambda function generates Ethereum wallet addresses and private keys from a provided mnemonic. The function increments an index with each execution to derive new wallets from the mnemonic sequence. Wallet data is stored securely in AWS DynamoDB.
Features

    Generates Ethereum wallet addresses and private keys.
    Stores wallet data in DynamoDB with high security.
    Manages an incremental index to derive new wallet addresses.

Prerequisites

    AWS Account with access to Lambda and DynamoDB.
    Node.js installed on your local machine for development.
    ethers.js library to handle Ethereum wallet generation.

Setup and Deployment

    Lambda Function Setup:
        Clone the repository to your local machine.
        Install dependencies with npm install aws-sdk ethers.
        Replace MNEMONICHERE in the code with your actual mnemonic.
        Zip the updated files along with node_modules.
        Create a new Lambda function in the AWS Console and upload the zip file.
        Set the execution role to allow Lambda functions to access DynamoDB.

    DynamoDB Configuration:
        Create a table named WalletData with a primary key id.
        Ensure the table has an item with the key index to store the last used index for address derivation.

    API Gateway Integration:
        Set up API Gateway to trigger the Lambda function via HTTP requests.
        Configure a POST method integration for your Lambda function.

Usage

    Endpoint: POST /generate-wallet
    Response Body:

    json

    {
      "address": "0x123...YourNewlyGeneratedWalletAddress"
    }

Security Considerations

    Important: Never expose your mnemonic in publicly accessible or shared environments. Always encrypt sensitive data.
    Configure IAM roles and policies to strictly limit who can access your Lambda function and DynamoDB table.

Error Handling

    Handles errors gracefully, providing clear error messages for failed operations.
    Includes detailed logging for easier troubleshooting.
