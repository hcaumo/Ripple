Title: AWS Lambda Token Minting Tool

Description:
This repository contains an AWS Lambda function for minting xDrexfy tokens to a user's Ethereum wallet. It leverages ethers.js for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain, and the function is triggered through an API Gateway endpoint.
Features

    Securely mints tokens to a specified wallet address.
    Utilizes Ethereum smart contracts via ethers.js.
    Integrates seamlessly with AWS Lambda and API Gateway for scalable deployments.

Prerequisites

    AWS Account with access to Lambda, API Gateway, and IAM.
    Node.js installed on your local machine for development.
    An Ethereum wallet and access to its private key.

Setup and Deployment

    Lambda Function Setup:
        Clone the repository to your local machine.
        Install necessary npm packages: npm install aws-sdk ethers.
        Configure your environment with appropriate security measures for handling private keys.
        Zip your project files including node_modules.
        Upload the zip file to AWS Lambda and configure the function to trigger via API Gateway.

    API Gateway Configuration:
        Set up an API Gateway to create an HTTPS endpoint.
        Configure the POST method to trigger your Lambda function.

    Security Configuration:
        Never hard-code private keys directly in the Lambda code. Use AWS Secrets Manager to manage your keys securely.
        Ensure your API endpoint is secured with appropriate authentication mechanisms.

Usage

    Endpoint: POST /mint-tokens
    Request Body:

    json

{
  "walletAddress": "0x...yourWalletAddress",
  "amount": "10"
}

Successful Response:

json

{
  "message": "Tokens minted successfully"
}

Error Response:

json

    {
      "message": "Invalid request"
    }

Security Considerations

    Use secure storage for private keys; do not hard-code them in your Lambda functions.
    Ensure that the API endpoint requires authentication to prevent unauthorized access.

Error Handling

    The function includes detailed error handling for both client-side and server-side errors.
    Errors are logged with comprehensive details for troubleshooting.
